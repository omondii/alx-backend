Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

    What a caching system is
    What FIFO means
    What LIFO means
    What LRU means
    What MRU means
    What LFU means
    What the purpose of a caching system
    What limits a caching system have


A caching system - a mechanism that stores frequently accessed data in a cache(storage space).
A cache is much faster to access than the original data source hence reduced response times. 
<u> Caching Systems </u>
-> Refers to a component used to store copies of frequently accessed data in a cache. 
1. <b> FIFO </b>
-> A cache replacement mechanism where the oldest items are removed first when the cache reaches its max capacity
